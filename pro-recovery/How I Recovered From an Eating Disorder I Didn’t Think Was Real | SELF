What kind of licensed professional would tell me to have a little ice cream at every meal? She just called pizza the perfect food because it hits a lot of food groups. Um, does she know how many calories are in a slice? I have never been more ready for Ashton Kutcher to appear and tell me I was in the middle of a prank.By this time I was surviving on a small baggie of Popchips a day. In my mind, Popchips were “good” for some inexplicable reason, and every other food was “bad.” But I didn’t have an eating disorder—at least I didn’t think I did. According to my late-night googling, my restrictive eating wasn’t a problem. I’d lost a lot of weight, but not enough to be diagnosed with anorexia as defined by the DSM. Without a label, I felt as if my struggles were invalid, not “real” enough to solve. So I didn’t try to solve them.When my parents wanted to go out for dinner, I’d eat an appetizer or some smaller meal, not wanting to draw attention to the fact that I was restricting my caloric intake. But then we’d get home and I’d quietly cry myself to sleep, feeling like I was spiraling out of my own control. Every time I ate something other than my portioned-out Popchips, it was like this boulder I had been rolling up a hill—a burden of weight loss and self-control—tumbled back to the bottom, and I had to start all over, restricting myself more and more as punishment.One day a mentor sat me down and said, “Hey, so we’re about to drive to your house together to talk to your parents. Don’t worry, they know we’re coming. But you need to tell us what’s going on, because people have noticed that you’re shrinking away, mentally and physically.” I remember sitting around our kitchen table, trying to explain how dissatisfied I was with myself. Trying to think of words that could convey how deeply these vulgar, unhealthy thoughts ran in my brain and in my bones, the way that deviating from my popped-potato diet made me feel like a devastating failure of a human. I didn’t know how to explain a problem I thought didn’t exist.At camp that summer, the camp leaders deemed me a health risk and took me to the hospital. Because of my BMI, the hospital staff weren’t sure what to put on my admittance bracelet. (I guess “Girl who is unhealthily obsessed with food and not eating but hasn’t lost enough weight to diagnose as anorexic” didn’t fit.) All the while I thought, Why aren’t you off attending to people who are actually sick? That girl has a broken arm! Go help her!!!Share via PinterestCourtesy of Jocelyn RuniceI still have this dress, but when I wear it now I have to fight the zipper a little. Also note the bracelet; this picture was taken shortly after getting back from the hospital.It seemed like no one really knew what to do with me. My parents got me a therapist and a dietitian. They drove me an hour away to meet with this small team of medical professionals who would put me back together. I wondered why everyone was making such a fuss about a problem I didn’t have. When I’d do Google searches for “anorexia BMI,” I’d find information that would convince me I didn’t qualify as anorexic and use this as evidence that nothing was wrong. I would do this after checking my stomach in the mirror and weighing myself, which occurred innumerable times a day.The dietitian, in a desperate attempt to get me to eat more calories, told me that it was OK to eat a small bite of ice cream at every meal. I was also told that pizza, because it contained elements from most food groups, was the optimal meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. She just wanted me to eat and was desperately trying to break my incomprehensible self-made rules of what I deemed good or bad. (My rules weren’t based in any kind of nutritional factPopchips and apple juice were good and light, but a small piece of chicken or steak was bad and too heavy.) One therapist analyzed me by asking, “Who would win in an arm wrestling match, you or your mom?” (We didn’t go back to him for any follow-up visits.) I was weighed multiple times and told my BMI, and how it didn’t fall into the anorexia category in the DSM. It would be more than four years before I’d learn about the term OSFED, short for "other specified feeding or eating disorder," which would help me understand what I had been going through. In the meantime I just wanted to yell, I know! I don’t have a problem! I’m not sick enough to warrant help.But I was sick. Even as I went away to college, eating more and more until I was recording 1,200 calories a day on my calorie-tracking app (a tool that helped me to eat more but also aided my obsession), I was still battling negative thoughts and disordered behaviors. My boyfriend broke up with me and I rushed to the bathroom with my pencil, trying to throw up, because maybe if I was 400 calories lighter he’d take me back—but oh wait, does graphite contain calories? (Not kidding, a real thought I had.) I’d poke and prod at my bloated stomach until it was red and covered with marks where my nails had dug too deep. I’d stop eating for a few days because I could feel a little stomach roll when I sat down. Most of the time I did all of these things unnoticed by friends and family. Other times I’d call my mom (ever patient, ever supportive) in tears, asking her why I was so fat, and why couldn’t I stop thinking about my body and food?And then, after a particularly bad week, I jumped on the Internet, desperate for someone else to be like, “Hey, I’m in this weird there’s-no-label space, too! This space where you’re not sick enough, but some kind of sick.” I wanted someone to tell me definitively what was wrong with my mind. Someone to tell me I deserved help, because I couldn’t decide that for myself. So I read blogs, stories, articles. I found people who had also occupied the DSM limbo I felt I was floating in and had managed to put themselves together.I came to the revelation that not qualifying for a disorder didn’t mean I was “ordered.” No, I didn’t bear a clear label of “bulimic” or ”anorexic,” but I still needed help and TLC. I came to understand that no label does not mean no problem.Share via PinterestCourtesy of Jocelyn RuniceCollege was especially hard because the most popular way to socialize was to grab brunch or get dinner after class.Ultimately I determined that what I'd been dealing with would fall under the umbrella of OSFED (known until a few years ago as EDNOS, or "eating disorder not otherwise specified"), which is a term for a number of eating disorders that don’t fit neatly into the definitions of anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or binge-eating disorder.Terms like OSFED and EDNOS—though fuzzy and often criticized—definitely help me feel more welcome, like I belong to a community that understands me. But I still struggle with the thought that I’m not “sick enough.” Even as I write this, I question whether I’m the most “valid” person to tell you their disordered eating story, because I can’t sum up my experiences with a quaint DSM-approved title. When National Eating Disorders Awareness Week rolls around, I shy into the corners, needing the empowering messages that float around during this time, but also waiting for Damian to shout, “You don’t even go here!”The obsessive thoughts still cycle constantly in my mind (“You’re too fat!” “Did you really just eat that?” “Why can’t you lose the weight?” “Should I weigh myself again?”), but I’ve slowly learned through experience that it’s OK to reach out when these thoughts become overwhelming. People want to talk and help you, regardless of what label you are or aren’t carrying around. And the more you talk about it—with yourself, your friends, family, doctors—the more you can understand why you think this way, and learn how to acknowledge your thoughts without letting them control you.If you think you have any kind of disordered eating, reach out! Tell someone! Tell your doctor! Don’t invalidate your feelings or your thoughts because you don’t believe you’re sick *enough* or broken *enough.* You deserve to be happy, healthy, and confident.If you or someone you know is at risk or experiencing an eating disorder, resources are available from the National Eating Disorders Association online, by phone at 800-931-2237, or by texting "NEDA" to 741741.WatchWhat Everyone Gets Wrong About Eating DisordersShare via facebook dialogShare via TwitterShare via PinterestKeywordseating disorders, ednos, osfedTrending1Fitness31 Best Fitness Gifts for Workout Fanatics in 20192Food15 Stress-Free Thanksgiving Recipes You Can Make in a Slow-Cooker3Food14 Foil-Pack Dinners You Can Make in Less Than 30 MinutesHealthMy Chronic Pain Took Almost a Decade to DiagnoseHealthI Have Depression and Anxiety.
