Hello all!This was a suggestion a few weeks back, but work has been crazy and I've actually had to do my job instead of sitting on reddit all day >.> Anyways, I've created an r/fuckeatingdisorders specific discord server for us to chat :)I'm completely discord illiterate, so I'm asking for any volunteers who would like to moderate to PM the mods. Additionally, we are going to carry over the rules of this subreddit to the discord server.Please PM the mods for the link to join the discord :)2962 commentssharesave31Posted byu/CozyJumpers27F | Recovering Anorexic10 days agoStickied postA List of Resources & Worksheets for Eating Disorder Recovery
Hey all, I notice a lot of people here often looking for resources on recovery, or on specific aspects of recovery, such as preventing relapses, stopping calorie counting, stopping body checking, etc. So I wanted to put together a list of resources that may be helpful for those seeking out or interested in recovery.The main resource in here is the list of 'Recovery Worksheets' from various online sources, most of these worksheets mainly use a modality called 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy' (CBT) which helps people learn how their thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected, and how to stop the harmful behavior associated.That being said, it's very important for me to mention that I am not a licensed clinical psychologist, and that recovery as a whole can differ a lot between people, what works for one person might not always work for another, so if you read through some of the resources below and don't find one to be particularly helpful for you, feel free to move past it and go on to the next, you know yourself and what you need best. Additionally, if you're currently in a position where you feel as though you need medical or therapeutic intervention and can't commit to recovery on your own, please do seek out the support you need. In the 'Additional Resources' section below, I've included a couple of links to low cost therapy options that might be helpful for some to utilize (they're only available in the U.S & Canada though - sorry about that, all the other resources mentioned however should be available worldwide).Recovery Worksheets:Tackling Avoided (Fear) Foods [PDF]Types of Thinking Traps in Eating Disorders [PDF]The Problems with Calorie Counting & How to Stop Counting Calories [PDF]Reducing Body Checking [PDF]Questions to Ask Yourself to Challenge Negative ThoughtsThe Cycle of Self Injury [PDF]Fact or Opinion?

Real ice cream. Not shitty icy powdery halo top. REAL ice cream. It’s been way too long. And I may have almost cried in the lead up, but I barely felt any anxiety eating it. I felt actual glee. My partner said I looked like a child eating ice cream for the first time. I guess I kind of was. In the act of repeating challenges I’m aiming to have ice cream at least two more times in the next week. I got this. You got this. We got this. ED ain’t got this.739 commentssharesave•Posted byu/gardencookCO1 hour agoMy value is not determined by appearance. My value is not determined by appearance. My value is not determined by appearance.

Right?•2 commentssharesave25Posted byu/IncognitoChihuahua9 hours agoRantHave you gained weight ?
This is clearly a vent/rant post. A bit of context. Yesterday was a very important day for me as I finally got the courage to go back to therapy and my first session was really great. But then, oh then, my mother.After I called her to tell her how great my session was, I called her back to tell her that maybe getting me for Xmas a smart watch might not be a good idea as I would ONLY use it to track my calories and justifie my meals to myself. Her answer ?"Why ? Have you gained weight ? Do you need new jeans ? You should do more exercise you know."Of course this conversation engendered a total breakdown in the middle of the street.Am I the only one who have to deal with... Clumsy parents ? I have tried to tell her that she can't tell me this things but she just keeps telling them...2510 commentssharesave8Posted byu/auamethyst4 hours agoFinding Joy in Eating Again
To all of you out thereeating has no rules. You can eat whatever you want, when you want it. No strict meal timing, no certain number of meals per day, no strict types of food you must eat.When you eat in accordance to when you are hungry and what your body is asking for at the moment, it is a very joyful experience.8commentsharesave97Posted byu/finsandfangs22 hours agoRecovery ProgressI'm going to get a milkshake tomorrow
Today was generally awful and it was not helped by craving a milkshake and being really hungry (crying for three hours isn't helped by stomach rumbling). I stood in the queue to order one then freaked out and got something else.I'm getting the damn milkshake tomorrow morning. I'm getting the cream and marshmallows and maybe I'll hide in the corner to drink it and cry a little but fuck it. Fuck anorexia. I want a milkshake.976 commentssharesave3Posted byu/honeyangell5 hours agoStrugglingRecovery struggle
I’m currently in recovery of my eating disorder, and I’m going to get my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow. After the surgery I will probably not be able to have anything solid for a couple of days, and I’m scared I’ll fall back into old habits of (liquid) fasting. What are some foods you’d recommend to eat/drink?33 commentssharesaveCommunity Detailsr/fuckeatingdisorders12.8kMembers26OnlineNov 14, 2014Cake DayEating disorders have many misconceptions, and part of that is because those who have it hide it since those who don't have it don't understand it because no one talks about it.
