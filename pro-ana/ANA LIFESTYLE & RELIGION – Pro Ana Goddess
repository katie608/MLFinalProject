ANA LIFESTYLE & RELIGION
Pro ana rules and commandments
1. If you aren’t thin you aren’t attractive.
2. Being thin is more important than being healthy.
3. You must buy clothes, cut your hair, take laxatives, starve yourself, do anything to make yourself look thinner.
4. Thou shall not eat without feeling guilty.
5. Thou shall not eat fattening food without punishing oneself afterwords.
6. Thou shall count calories and restrict intake accordingly.
7. What the scale says is the most important thing.
8. Losing weight is good/gaining weight is bad.
9. You can never EVER be too thin.
10. Being thin and not eating are signs of true will power and success.
______________________________________________________________
1.) Never admit you are skinny enough
2.) Binges should only occur at a maximum of once every six weeks and must be kept private, if you expect perfection. Purging and excessive exercise MUST follow… otherwise, thou art a failure.
3.) Never let your stomach growl. You can control it.
4.) 10 glasses of water a day, 10 sticks of gum, 10 diet sodas, and 10 cups of black coffee must be consumed on a regular basis for your perfect body’s essential needs.
5.) Wrist bones are infatuation. Ribs are sexy. Collar bones are beautiful. Hip bones are love. Back bones are submission, but the two bones that connect ankle to your foot, those are perfection.
6.) Flat stomachs are banned. con-caved stomachs are the only kind acceptable.
7.) You shall fast at least 5-7 days from every month…. and exercise 7 days a week, at least 2 hours each time.
8.) You shall weigh yourself at least three times a day and hate yourself no matter what the number it is.
9.) Never give up on what you want most. Ana loves you only if you’re thin.
10.) Recovery is a sin… but sins are forgiven. Remember obesity is a crime and crimes are on your permanent record FOREVER
________________________________________________________________
1. Look in the mirror tell yourself you are fat.
2. Don’t believe what others say about you.
3. Look at pictures of skinny girls daily and become like them.
4. Don’t think or eat food at all. 5. Food makes you fat. Any food makes you fat.
6. Drink as much water as you can. If you feel like you are going to explode, drink more.
7. Go to the mall and try on clothes two sizes two small for you so you will be motivated to not eat and to fit into them.

Why I starve myself
Because I can
Because I’m the hunger artist
Because I want to
Because if I can accomplish this, I can do anything!
Because off all the people in my life who die of jealousy when they see the way I look
Because it makes me feel brand new every day!
Because I just won’t quit
Because I have wanted to be this way forever
Because I don’t have any time to waste on food
Because I can do anything I put my mind to
Because I have the willpower
Because it’s my life
Because it’s my choice
Because of my next birthday
Because it’s me. And though I don’t advise it to anyone else; I’m too thin, and I don’t eat enough, and that’s me, and I love it!
Because I want to be skinny for summer

Ana’s Psalm
Strict is my diet
I must nog want
It maketh me lie down at night hungry
It leadeth me past the confectioners
It trieth my will power
It leadeth me in the paths of alternation for my figure sake
Yeah, though I walk trough the aisles of the pastry department, I will buy no sweet rolls for they are fattening
The cakes and the pies, they tempt me
Before me is a table set with green beens and lettuce
I filleth my stomach with liquids
My day’s quota runneth over
Surely calorie and weight charts will follow me, all days of my life
And I will dwell in the fear of the scales forever

Ana’s Laws
Thin is beauty; therefore I must be thin, and remain thin, If I wish to be loved. Food is my ultimate enemy. I may look, and I may smell, but I may not touch!
I must think about food every second of every minute of every hour of every day… and ways to avoid eating it.
I must weigh myself, first thing, every morning, and keep that number in mind throughout the remainder of that day. Should that number be greater than it was the day before, I must fast that entire day.
I shall not be tempted by the enemy (food), and I shall not give into temptation should it arise. Should I be in such a weakened state and I should cave, I will feel guilty and punish myself accordingly, for I have failed her.
I will be thin, at all costs. It is the most important thing; nothing else matters.
I will devote myself to Ana. She will be with me where ever I go, keeping me in line. No one else matters; she is the only one who cares about me and who understands me. I will honor Her and make Her proud
