These are some quotes that I find particuarly inspiring...
"I had a hole in my heart, so I threw away my plate, because nothing filled me up, no matter what I ate."
"Fasting is a medicine" - St. John
"Self control is the quality that distinguishes the fittest to survive" - George Bernard Shaw
Nothing tastes as good as thin feels
"In eating a third of the stomach should be filled with food, a third with drink and the rest left empty" -
Talmud
"I saw few die of hunger, of eating 100,000" - Benjamin Franklin
In the body, as in sculpture, perfection is not attained when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing
left to take away.
"In general, mankind, since the improvement of cookery, eat twice as much as nature requires" - Benjamin Franklin
"Most people eat as though they were fattening themselves for the market"
"Three good meals a day is bad living" - Benjamin Franklin
How many pounds till I am happy?
How many pounds till I get thin?
Three more pounds till I am skinny
Three more pounds and I win!
I do eat normally - only what is needed for survival. I can't help that we live in a piggish society where gluttony is
the norm and everyone else is constantly stuffing themselves.
"through prayer, fasting and meditation I will drop below 100 pounds, the dreaded three digits. I want to be 99 or
nothing. want. did I say want? I shouldn't say want. I shouldn't say shouldn't. you're confused?... I'm trying to eliminate
my ego but that action is ego itself. all action is ego. are you following me? I'm not here with my mirror and scale for the
good of my health." - 'Tis by Frank McCourt
"I want a body with sharp edges" I say after a while, because she won't let me wriggle out of an answer.
"Sometimes I am hungry. I'm always hungry. But when I don't eat I feel good. Pure. I feel empty and it's wonderful.
I feel so powerful. Like I could fly."
I feel bloated, huge, disgusting, ugly, a monstrous lumbering sow of a woman, a greedy revolting red-faced creature, and
every bite, I feel myself swelling, I'm punished for breaking the first commandment, don't eat more than a small bird because
it's unladylike and you'll get fat and no one will like you, but it's too late, I can feel the sharpness of my cheekbones
sinking, swamped under spongy bulges of flesh, my thighs spreading like warm lard
and sticking together, so it's much safer not to eat.
What I wouldn't do to be Alice climbing through the looking glass, taking one of those pills that makes you small, so
small. What I wouldn't do to be less
- Elizabeth Wurtzel, Prozac Nation
