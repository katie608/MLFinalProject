The world is rife with larger than life causes. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines religion as “a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith” and that is exactly what Pro-Anorexia or Pro Ana is.The world is obsessed with the prospect of being thin. Nowhere is this more pronounced than with Pro-Anorexia or Pro Ana Tips. Pro Ana inspires a cult-like devotion among Anas or Rexies as Pro Ana enthusiasts like to be called.Contents1 So, what exactly is Pro Ana?2 Pro Ana Tips & Tricks2.1 #1 Create a Motivational ​List2.2 #2 Have a Target2.3 #3 Monitor your Food Intake2.4 #​4 Breakfast2.5 #​5 Purge Yourself2.6 #​6 Fasting2.7 #​7 Keep Hydrated2.8 #​8 Citric and mineral intake2.9 #​9 Stand In front of the Mirror Often2.10 #1​0 Wear short clothes2.11 #1​1 Get Plenty of Rest2.12 #1​2 Follow the Eating Rules2.13 #1​3 Communal diets2.14 #1​4 Try to go Vegan2.15 #1​5 Try eating alone2.16 #1​6 Exercises2.17 #1​7 Make an exercise routine2.18 #1​8 Reward Yourself2.19 #19 Follow diet rules3 My Personal Secret to Constant Weight Loss4  Beginner’s Pro Ana Diet5 The Three-Week Diet6 Skinny Bitch Diet6.1 WEEK ONE6.1.1 Monday6.1.2 Tuesday6.1.3 Wednesday6.1.4 Thursday6.1.5 Friday6.1.6 Saturday6.1.7 Sunday7 The Vegan Model Diet8 The Mixed Carb 400 Diet9 The Rainbow Diet 9.1 Monday (white):9.2 Tuesday (yellow):9.3 Wednesday (fast):9.3.1 Thursday (orange):9.3.2 Friday (red):9.4 Saturday (purple/blue):9.5 Sunday (green):10 Objectives of Pro Ana Support Sites11 Facets of the Pro Ana Lifestyle11.1 Methods11.2 Devotion12 Pro Ana Symbols 13 Pro-Ana Bracelets14 Pro Ana Shirts and Other Merchandise15 Pro Ana Songs16 Pro Ana Books17 Facts about Anorexia17.1 Types of Anorexia17.2 Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa17.3 Causes of Anorexia17.4 Biological Causes of Anorexia include:17.5 Treatment of Anorexia18 Final Words:So, what exactly is Pro Ana?Pro Ana encourages a lifestyle of weight loss. Anas want to attain a super slim body with the coveted thigh gap and low BMI.Pro Ana is not at all a new concept. It has been around for decades donning different names. Lately, Pro Ana has gained a lot of traction as Anas and Rexies created numerous websites to encourage each other and to offer tips and tricks on how to stay on diet and achieve weight loss.If you are looking for support groups for the Pro Ana lifestyle you will not have to look far. You have, however, to be prepared for tough language and body shamming that is the backbone of Pro Ana inspiration. But majorly, these sites provide a sense of belonging for Rexies who otherwise feel isolated and misunderstood because although the world’s media perpetuate the “thinner is better” narrative, individuals in the real world do not understand the excessive need for weight lossPro Ana Tips & TricksDietary Supplement Thathelped me to reduce my weight within a week
Show me now #1 Create a Motivational ​ListList all the bad food you should not eat until you achieve your target weight. Plus, download and put up pictures of people who inspire you all over your walls as a constant reminder of your goal.#2 Have a TargetSet a target of your ideal weight (which should be below the recommended BMI weight) before you begin a diet. It is also advised that Anas set periodic target weights for each week that are realistic and which they can attain.#3 Monitor your Food IntakeTrack your calories input throughout the day. Therefore, Pro Ana sites provide calories calculators and encourage the use of apps for the same purpose. The goal of this activity is to ensure that you always consume less calories than your body burns up through exercise and normal body activities.#​4 BreakfastNever, ever skip breakfast because it fills the stomach and keeps you fuller for longer. This means that you will engage in less poor snacking habits throughout the day.#​5 Purge YourselfPurge yourself e.g. through vomiting, after every meal to reduce the number of calories that are absorbed by your body. Use laxatives to force the body to purge most of what you have consumed before the body has a chance to digest and use it.#​6 FastingIntermittent fasting is highly encouraged and this phase is combined with the pre-established exercise regimen so Anas are still losing weight even as they fail to consume anything. Therefore, the body is forced burn up its fat stores to keep running.#​7 Keep HydratedDrink a lot of water because water is like a magic pill. Not only does it keep your body hydrated and functional, it also fills your stomach making you eat less food. Consume a lot of tea and coffee which are commonly known to be appetite suppressant.#​8 Citric and mineral intakeThe drinks should be consumed black and with minimal sugar so as to reduce the calories added by milk and sugar. Drink a lot of lemon water especially in the morning as this helps you’re your digestive system healthy.#​9 Stand In front of the Mirror OftenOther than eating in front of the mirror, Anas are encouraged to spend time in front of the mirror daily to evaluate themselves and keep motivated.#1​0 Wear short clothesDress in short revealing clothes to enable you to easily keep track of areas of your body that you need to work on.On the plus side, this also allows you see the parts of your body that you do not like and this will only serve to keep you motivated to change the parts you don’t like.#1​1 Get Plenty of RestMake sure to sleep for at least six hours each day because sufficient rest will keep the body energized and keep your metabolic rate high.#1​2 Follow the Eating RulesEat many small meals spread throughout the day as opposed to three large ones. Spreading meals helps to improve metabolism and makes you eat less.#1​3 Communal dietsParticipate in communal diets as opposed to the taking part in solitary diets because buddies can share problems and successes and keep each other motivated to observe the diet to its conclusion.#1​4 Try to go VeganGo Vegan to reduce the dreaded animal fats found in animal products including milk and eggs. Consume vitamin pills to supplement the required vitamins and minerals that they fail to provide their bodies with due to their dismal dietary consumption while avoiding fast food and other oily foods at all costs.#1​5 Try eating aloneAnas are encouraged to sometimes eat alone so as to keep their “lifestyle choice” a secret from their loved ones for as long as possible.Psychologically, this is a common cult technique because it leaves the individuals lonely with the only source of comfort coming from the community. #1​6 ExercisesExercise compulsively and ensure that you burn a lot more calories than you consume throughout the day. Pro Ana sites encourage members to exercise past the muscle exhaustion rate leading to fainting spells due to excessive exhaustion.Pick an area of your body to concentrate on each time and pick exercises that help you trim that part of your body. For example, sits ups help you lose belly fat.#1​7 Make an exercise routineFaithfully observe a fixed exercise routine and do not divert from it. This technique helps because human beings are mostly creatures of habit making it easier, over time, to follow a set routine than to exercise at any odd time of the day while relying on an individual’s sense of discipline.#1​8 Reward YourselfMembers are encouraged to reward themselves for finishing a diet, completing a series of exercises and of course, weight loss. Such rewards are, of course, non-dietary and include rewards such as holidays, clothes, jewelry etc.#19 Follow diet rulesRexies also have to follow the rules of the diet they being and strive to never break any of them. Members are therefore advised to keep a record of the rules in their weight loss diary throughout their weight loss journey.Now that you are well appraised on the tricks of being a Rexie, you know you have to watch what you eat as well as exercise what you do eat so you can exorcise those calories. Here is a sample diet for your perusal
My Personal Secret to Constant Weight Loss​The journey to weight loss is challenging especially by following Pro Ana Diet Plan. Anorexia is a disease that we do not encourge you to follow. I found a secret to getting out of this recurring funk. Beginner’s Pro Ana DietWeek 1Week 2Week 3 Week 4Day 1, 2 and 3 Limit your diet to 700 caloriesDay 4, 5, and 6 Keep a 500-calorie limit and don’t eat any bread, pasta, or cerealDay 7- fruit fastLimit diet to 500 calorie and don’t eat any bread, pasta, or cerealFruit fastDay 1, 2, and 3- fruit fast and one cup of fruit juice each dayDay 4- fruit fastDay 5, 6, and 7- soup fast, but don’t include any creamy or high calorie varietiesBeing a Rexie requires loads of exercises. To keep up with the weight loss and to avoid plateauing (reaching a constant point where you don’t lose any more weight), you have to try different exercises.The main objective here is to make sure that you lose more calories than you consume. Here is a workout lifestyle that you can adopt, especially when you are home.
20 Crunches every other hour
15 minutes power walk at least 3 times a day
10 minutes of a freezing cold shower at least twice a dayThe Three-Week DietYou may also like to try the newest most inspiring Three-Week Diet by Brian Flatt. The Flatts have years of experience with weight loss as well as Anorexia and Bulimia.The Three-Week Diet focuses on making you lose 25 to 30 pounds in just 3 weeks.This diet by Brian Flatt retails at $47 and is sold as a PDF Document. Each week, the diet introduces a new phase where Pro Anas are gradually weaned of bad foods in favor of whole foods.Dieters are expected to go through the following five stages:
Consuming few calories
Frequent, intermittent fasting
ExerciseCheck Circle
Reduced carbohydrate consumptionCheck Circle
Use of supplements.The meal plan by pro ana tips and tricks is accompanied by a workout manual that when utilized, increases the weight loss results. The plan requires twenty minutes of exercise for three to four days a week.Upon completion of the diet, you must monitor your body weight daily and should you gain three pounds, go back on the diet immediately. Repeat until your body is unable to regain the weight. This is referred to as the three-pound rule.Brian Flatt is very straight forward in his motivation to encourage you to lose weight and keep it off. Meanwhile, here are a few inspiration quotes that we found to be greatNothing tastes as good as skinny feelsDo not reward yourself with food. You’re not a dogHungry to bed. Hungry to rise makes a girl a smaller sizeIf you have to eat, eat in front of the mirrorThere are lots of other diets to try. For example, the Skinny Bitch Diet has been a real inspiration to many Anas.Skinny Bitch DietThe Skinny Bitch Diet is presented in a bestselling book titled Skinny Bitch which has been co-authored by Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin who are both veterans of the model industry.This diet calls for a complete vegan diet with a dedicated fast from all animal products, sugar and processed fats.You have to take a fruity breakfast, vegetables for lunch and fake patties (chicken/ beef) or tofu for dinner. This is generally the heaviest meal of the day.You will love the kick-ass motivational quotes in the Skinny Bitch Diet book that leave you with no goal other than to lose more weight. There will be no more meats, dairy products or white flour for you.Here is a sample diet plan from the Skinny Bitch bookWEEK ONEMondayBreakfast: Mango, banana, kiwi and soy yogurt Lunch: Spinach salad w/ shredded carrots, chopped almonds, red onion, fresh garlic, cubed tofu and sesame oil Dinner: Pasta with zucchini, tomatoes, garlic, fresh parsley, pine nuts and olive oil TuesdayBreakfast: Fresh squeezed orange juice, whole grain muffin with soy butter, banana and strawberries Lunch: Tabouli salad with marinated tofu, eggplant, and red peppers Dinner: Veggie nachos - corn chips with veggie chili, soy cheese, guacamole, scallions and tomatoes WednesdayBreakfast: Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and slow-cooked oatmeal with blueberries, strawberries and raspberries Lunch: Veggie burger on whole grain bun with red onion, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and alfalfa sprouts.

Here is a perfect one to attain the thigh gap (Note that all diets and exercises are drawn from internet sources). Objectives of Pro Ana Support SitesThe Pro Ana lifestyle is a lonely one. With the growing resistance towards the ProAna way of life, Rexies often get lonely and need to connect with other Rexies who are on the same journey.If you search well enough, you will find support sites as well as Whatsapp groups that offer support and advice.Facets of the Pro Ana LifestyleMethodsPro Ana forums share weight loss tips, motivational messages and images and communal dieting opportunities.DevotionPro Anorexia enthusiasts have found solace in the “Goddess of emaciation” . She is the true image of skinny=beautiful and she offers constant encouragement to her subjects.Some site owners even write letters from Ana which serve as encouragement for the members to keep up the lifestyle.Follow Pro Ana Rules to the letterPro Ana sites encourage rule following with sayings such as, “What nourishes me destroys me”.All Anas must follow the commandments and directions, failure to which they will face thorough punishment.Anas must maintain confidentiality at all times.Pro Ana sites are largely private groups and admission to these sites requires approval by the site’s administrators. New members are therefore forced to post their current and ideal weight, age and sex on the site before they can be approved to join the community. Members must post photographs of themselves, accompanied by their body statistics as well as keep members updated of their weight loss progressPro Ana Symbols The dragonfly is seen to be the symbol for Pro Ana. Anas, as Pro Ana enthusiasts refer to themselves, identify with this insect because of its long, thin body, beautiful/ colorful body color and its light, translucent wings.Pro-Anna individuals see these insects as the epitome of beauty and elegance, a state in which they hope to achieve themselves.A silver dragonfly charm features in red bracelets to separate them from regular bracelets and to further help Anas identify each other on the streets. Further, the addition of the dragonfly charm indicates a sense of pride in the practice.Pro-Ana BraceletsRed bracelets with a dragonfly charm. These bracelets come in many different designs and can even be made at home as perpetuated by DIY sites. Sites that carry the merchandise sell them for between $10 to $35.The tag “Red Bracelet Project” now features on most Pro Ana sites encouraging their followers to wear the bracelet as a secret message to each other so they can identify each other on the streets while remaining unobtrusive enough to be ignored by those outside the religion.Such tricks are psychological games intended to make the lifestyle appear more interesting and fun for its followers at an age when the fad is receiving increasing criticism.Further, the colorful and beautiful bracelets serve as a constant reminder to Anas that they should keep up the practices while serving as a badge of honor to those who are “succeeding”.People who defend the Pro Ana bracelets claim that they provide a way for people who are suffering from anorexia to identify each other and those who will not judge them as they work through their problems.They, therefore, use this sense of community narrative to justify the wearing of Pro Ana bracelets but there are more people wearing the bracelets who are current subscribers of the religion than those who are recovering from it.In essence, they take advantage of the isolation felt by those suffering from Anorexia, which is a not so common mental illness, by selling them the “community narrative” which only draws them back to the lifestyle they are struggling to leave all for the sake of a few bucks.Pro Ana Shirts and Other MerchandiseFor those who dislike wearing bracelets, a red t-shirt on Mondays is advised. These serve the same role played by the bracelets and help Pro Ana individuals recognize each other on the street.But as the fad increasingly gains momentum, online shopping malls are now openly selling Pro Ana branded merchandise such as shirts, mugs, bags and more. Pro Ana SongsThis was perhaps the most shocking discovery of my research into this underground fad.A musician called King Adora has a song titled Big Isn’t Beautiful with lyrics such as “I want to feel my bones on your bones,” “Skinny is sexy, sweet anorexia, skinny is sexy, big isn’t beautiful” and other similarly catchy lyrics.Other artists in this genre include Catatonia, Jill Sobule, Outcast Youth, Anorexic Beauty, Lemon and so much more.The songs are disturbing to say the least and they further feed into the fears of most youths who seek love and acceptance.Pro Ana BooksAs stated above, Skinny Bitch is a best-selling book that advocates the Pro Ana lifestyle which is rampant in the modeling industry. It is one of many books but all would be well if the books only sold dietary plans because then most of those exposed to them would be those who actively seek them out.However, the sad reality is that the sites have resulted in an upsurge in the rate of romance novels that simply romanticize this notion.A cursory search of Wattpad, a popular online novels site, indicates that the hashtags Pro Ana Tips, Anorexia and Pro Mia (standing for those who advocate for Bulimia) are common and rampantly used.The psychological effect of this is that readers who are simply seeking fictional tales will be exposed to a romanticized version of the diseases (Anorexia and Bulimia) leading to their eventual desensitization of the seriousness of the illnesses.This situation creates alarm because these readers could end up joining the religion without a proper understanding of its ramification, especially for the vulnerable youth who may already be facing body image issues.Facts about AnorexiaAnorexia Nervosa is a life-threatening psychological disease which is characterized by an eating disorder resulting in extremely low body weight relative to the body mass index (BMI) of those suffering from it. Types of AnorexiaThere are two major types of this disease and they are:Restrictive Anorexia where the individuals literally starve themselves by consuming lower than the required quantities of food required to maintain a healthy body weightPurge Anorexia whereby the individuals suffering from the disease purge themselves by vomiting, using laxatives or excessively exercising. This behavior arises from an intense sense of guilt from eating too much food or eating the wrong type of food. Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa
Rapid weight loss
Consistent under feeding and dieting behavior
Being emaciated and underweightCheck Circle
Fastidious calories countingCheck Circle
Obsession with food even though the individual mostly keeps from eatingCheck Circle
Ritualistic eating behavior such as eating aloneCheck Circle
DepressionCheck Circle
Isolation behavior whereby the individual withdraws from his/ her close family and friends and prefers to be alone.Check Circle
Cold sensation all over the body but especially in the extremities such as the hands and finger;Check Circle
Amenorrhea which refers to lack of menstruation for at least three consecutive cyclesCheck Circle
Thinning and loss of hairCheck Circle
Lanugo which is fine hair growing all over the body including the faceCauses of AnorexiaAnorexia has been attributed to a variety of environmental and biological factors.The environmental factors are:The media which perpetuates the thinner is better narrative whereby the beautiful and happy individuals are portrayed as thin people. Anorexia is therefore a byproduct of this cultureSome professions such as modeling, acting, and dancing also cause this disease because they promote the thinness culture for success in such field;Peer pressure to be thin can result in anorexia especially among the youth who value acceptance in society and associate it to their personal image or view of success.Traumatic history or events such as sexual abuse can also cause Anorexia the same way they can cause other self-destructive behaviorBiological Causes of Anorexia include:Irregular hormone functionsGenetics although scientist are yet to establish the actual link between genetics and anorexia.Treatment of AnorexiaThe treatment of an individual suffering from anorexia includes a combination of medical, nutritional and therapeutic factors.Medical aid seeks to treat the symptoms which include amenorrhea and malnutrition, nutritional aid helps the patient come up with a new and healthier meal plan to restore the excess lost body weight.Patients are also trained on the importance of better eating patterns. Finally, a therapist counsels the patient to help them understand the actual issues the patient is suffering from so as to address them and prevent the patient from relapsing into anorexic behavior. Final Words:Ultimately, the Pro Ana tips and tricks is all about perception. It is important to remember that your health should be the number one priority.Truth be told, there are some crazy tips associated with Pro Ana or Thinspiration lifestyles so keep a sober head on your shoulders and even as you endeavor to lose weight, you don’t practice the extremist practices out there.It is also worth mentioning that some despicable characters out there who pretend to be in the Pro Ana lifestyle but they are pedophiles and phishing experts.Be careful who you engage in so the only thing you lose is those stubborn calories and nothing else.To all my Rexies out there, let the lifestyle continue, let’s go slim!

ann onomus Girls, YOU are BEAUTIFUL just the way you are! Being skinny shouldn’t define who you are as a person. God created you beautiful no matter if you are a size 3 or a size 16. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Anorexia is a real disease and I would feel so bad if any of you died because you starved yourself! You don’t have to cheat yourself with anorexia. Healthy is Beautiful! A size 16 is beautiful! Love yourself.

Anonymous It honestly makes me so sad and disgusted to see people promoting an eating disorder that can really hurt you. Anorexia is serious and has killed multiple young girls, so why are people promoting this ‘healthy’ diet? If you really want to lose weight, please don’t follow these tips; instead try something healthier. Just letting you know that you are beautiful the way you are and that you shouldn’t listen to what this blog says, again, it can really harm you and I can promise you it won’t make you feel good a all.

Madison Luckman This is just absolutey disgusting that you would promote a diet to help people become sick! People need help, not motivation to starve themselves.. How sick this makes me feel

I would recommend to anyone trying to lose weight to take a physical job and join a gym of some kind. My particular situation was housecleaning and joining Curves. Over the course of a few months I lost weight but more importantly shaped my body to the point where I lost sizes and felt so much better about myself. My diet did not change very much…I was so busy that I did not have time to eat a lot; healthy food tasted wonderful and exercise replaced opportunities to think about junk food.

Rachel This website is dangerous. Anorexia is a killer! Treatment for recovery should be sought not tips on how to lose more weight. Losing more weight will put your life at risk. The pain anorexia causes a whole family is not positive. Please find help to recover life will be so much better.

R I have tried to lose weight multiple times and then gained all 45 lbs back plus more due to medication for severe anxiety and depression but I still dont eat as much, but how do I lose weight fast even though I am excercising and barely eating.

Anon You are the reason sites that promote support such as MPA get shamed. We’re not a cult. We’re not “Anas and Rexies”. Fuck off, 12-year old with too much time on your hands.Going vegan and eating breakfast will not make you lose weight, it’s all bullshit, educate yourself a little before you shitpost stuff like that
