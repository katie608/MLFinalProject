Tricks of theÂ Trade
Thereâ€™s a lot of crap-lousy tips out there. We need to get some things straight. The tips youâ€™ll see here are some youâ€™ve probably already seen, and others you havenâ€™t. We need to at least attempt to trash the dangerous and useless tips in favor of some more relative information. These are general tips and tricks, like the lists youâ€™re used to. But these have all been researched, tested and tried, and these are reliable. Read on!
WaterYes, the basic of all dieting staples. You should be drinking eight glasses a day at the very bare minimum, but your best best is to drink about 8oz. every hour on the hour. Start with a glass of water as soon as you wake up. I keep a glass by my bed and drink it before I ever get up. Cold water will burn a few minor calories, as it does take caloric energy for your body to warm the water. But itâ€™s marginal, at best. Warm or hot water, however, will make you feel full and curb appetite. Warm water is a great craving remedy, too.NEVER drink tap water. Distilled or filtered would be a little better, but not much. If you can drink pure spring water or osmosis-filtered water, thatâ€™d be awesome. Water toxins will screw with your metabolism and hypothalamus (the gland that controls metabolism and cravings) more than anything else. Donâ€™t forget to make your teas and coffees with it, too.
CravingsÂ They royally suck, donâ€™t they? No worries. Ana can help. As mentioned before, warm water can definitely curb cravings. So can gum, peppermint (watch out, though, because thereâ€™s 25 calories in a piece of peppermint candy), tea, coffee, and water chugging. Brush your teeth, as this will make food taste funny. The worst Iâ€™ve found is Crest for kids. Get the bubble mint stuff thatâ€™s only a dollar from the dollar store. The toothpaste itself isnâ€™t nasty, but it makes everything else taste that way. Brush when you get up in the morning, once in midday, and again at night. The anti-cavity fluoride will also help with the acid that erodes your teeth when you purge.Do NOT try crushing the food in your hands and smelling it. Thatâ€™s a tip thatâ€™s circulated around. Iâ€™m telling you, smelling a food youâ€™re craving, or even just seeing it, will make you much more likely to eat it. Your best best is to toss it, sabotage it with salt or water or spices, or feed it to the family pet. Smelling or seeing the food will immediately make you salivate, because your mouth is preparing to receive the food. Thatâ€™s when your brain kicks into high gear and screams at you to eat it. Donâ€™t tempt your body.When all else fails, just walk away.
Hunger.Â Donâ€™t even kid yourself. Yes, we tell our concerned loved ones we arenâ€™t hungry, but unless youâ€™re emaciated, you definitely get hungry. Itâ€™s part of it. Any warm or hot liquids, like chicken broth, bullion, coffee, tea, or warm water will make you feel full if you drink enough. You can water chug, which just means you just chug water until you canâ€™t anymore, or you feel sick. (Careful not to drink so much that you shock your body. People have DIED from drinking too much water in one sitting. Never drink more than two gallons of water a day.) When all else fails, you can pull out a list of safe foods and pick one to go crazy on. Sometimes, you have to. My binges usually include nothing except sugar-free jello. At most, you might take in 200 calories, and thatâ€™s if you eat with a shovel.People will eat out of boredom. Occupy yourself with a hobby or a forgotten chore.Â Chew ice. It gives you a little extra water and distracts your hungry brain.Â Fiber will make your stomach feel full before anything else will. Invest in some Metamucil (watch the calories in that stuff). And always include fiber-rich foods in your calorie intake. If it doesnâ€™t have fiber, donâ€™t eat it.
Hiding ItThis can be a very tricky part that I tread on lightly. At a certain point, you donâ€™t want it to be hidden anymore, or need for it to be. But there are times when itâ€™s necessary not to let anyone know what youâ€™re doing. When youâ€™re already fat like I am, itâ€™s not as big of a deal to cover your tracks. But you do want people to think that the weight is coming off in a healthier style. And if you live by yourself, lucky, lucky youâ€¦Â Baggy clothes can hide the weight loss. If you lose weight too rapidly, or if youâ€™re thinner and show weight loss faster, itâ€™s important that you donâ€™t show it off all at once.Â Leave dirty dishes around. Dispose of leftovers in the refrigerator and leave trace amounts on a plate for whoever you live with to find.Â Unless you have very specific eating rituals that you simply cannot break, never eat alone. Any allowed caloric intake for that day should be saved to eat in front of other people. Then who can say youâ€™re starving?Â If you have a dog, bless your soul. Obviously, donâ€™t give your dog anything that can hurt them, like chocolate or grapes. But if your dog begs, you can sneak them food. This is incredibly useful for family dinners that you canâ€™t get out of.Speaking of family dinners, keep a napkin in your lap and drop food into it occasionally. Make sure not to leave the napkin on the plate when youâ€™re done. Youâ€™d be surprised at the number of anas that make this mistake. Throw your own napkin away.Donâ€™t try the trick where you spit your food into a glass. Whoever came up with this was stupid. The food floats up, and itâ€™s right there for everyone to see. Seriously, donâ€™t even attempt it.Â At dinners, do go ahead and eat a few bites, making sure someone is watching you do it. Fake chew now and then while cutting the food into smaller pieces and pushing them around a bit.Talk a LOT. This keeps the thoughts off of you, and your mouth is too busy talking to eat anything.Wear makeup to hide any paleness or dark circles.Your lips WILL chap. Start using a moisturizing chap stick, even if your lips arenâ€™t chapped right now. Rest assured, your time will come, especially if youâ€™re purging.
PurgingThere comes a time when weâ€™re all going to do it. And if something is worth doing, itâ€™s worth doing right. Purging is an art that it took me years to master. Now, itâ€™s about as simple as using the bathroom, and itâ€™s become about as natural as such, too. So for that reason, these tips might not work for you, or they may unlock your purging potential. Either way, here are some relatively safe purging tips. (DisclaimerÂ There is NO SUCH THING as safe purging.)Sip water in between bites to make food come up easier. You can also use a diet soda, as the bubbles will help food come up. Some people swear by chugging one in advance.If you know youâ€™re going to purge, stay away from anything spicy or sharp. Spicy food will burn like hell, and sharp foods like chips or popcorn can potentially cut something that doesnâ€™t need cutting, making your throat or esophagus bleed.Â Anything will come up with enough water. Remember that.Â When you think youâ€™ve gotten it all up, drink some water and purge some more. You can get some remaining remnants out that you didnâ€™t even know were in there.Stuff like bread or cake, if not chewed well, will clump together and cause you to choke. Anas and mias have choked to death purging bread. Avoid it like the plague. When weâ€™re binging, we tend not to chew well, anyway. Better safe than sorry.Laxatives about once a month is good for cleaning out your system routinely. But much more often than that, youâ€™re going to build a dependency to them, meaning you wonâ€™t be able to poop without them at all. By the time you use laxatives, youâ€™ve absorbed the food, anyway. Why bother? Just puke. Much more efficient.Â The crap about retaining half the calories you eat despite purging is, like I said, crap. If you look into the details of the study that came up with this theory, youâ€™d understand why. Actually, itâ€™s been proven time and time again that calories arenâ€™t absorbed until they reach the small intestines. All the stomach does is churn and prepare the food for the small intestines, and that can take over an hour depending on the density of the food you ate. Purge within twenty minutes, and youâ€™re good.Â Keep your fingers in your throat until itâ€™s all gone. The more you pull out, the harder it is to finish the job.Â Ice cream is every bulimicâ€™s dream food. Eat your fill! Itâ€™s a charm coming up again.Very few things are more degrading than having vomit slosh back up and hit you in the face. Put some toilet paper in the bowl to curb that.You can say youâ€™re taking a shower and then just puke in the shower. I do this so I can eat dinner and keep everyone off my back. Just make sure the food is chewed up well enough to go down the drain. Otherwise, youâ€™ve got a lot of explaining to do.Some people use toothbrushes and say not to use the bristle side. But if you use the other side, the angle wonâ€™t be right to his your gag reflex. Use the bristle side, and kinda rub that part of your tongue. A lot of people struggle with purging for years before finding this tip, and it seems to be the magic to the trick.
Any more tried and true tips you have, email them to me at litenme@icloud.com and Iâ€™ll review them for the site. If theyâ€™re legit and healthy, Iâ€™ll add it and give you credit! Remember, it helps to do your own research, too. All these tips have studies and evidence to back them up. They are NOT random tips. We donâ€™t play that kind of game here. ðŸ˜‰
