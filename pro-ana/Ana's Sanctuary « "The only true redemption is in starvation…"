My Water Fast!
Jan21
Hey, guys! I’m super excited that I’m finally going to do a real fast.
I want to keep an ongoing log about my day to day progress, and that can be a lot of information. So, I’ve set up an account on livejournal that you’re all welcome to go check out. You’ll find the link here. Can’t wait! (If anyone wants to join me, feel free! I’d love to have an accountability partner.)

I plan on updating my own life on here soon, and I appreciate you guys for your patience while I work to improve the site. Thank you so much, Ana and Mia angels. You guys are amazing!

I’m Back
Jan12
I got away from this website, and I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize how many people were coming to this site and really finding it helpful. I promise I’m going to be posting much more, and I’ll be sharing any and all LEGIT information I can find. You guys may know by now, but for anyone who doesn’t, the “tips and tricks” and “hiding it” junk you find on most pro-ana/mia sites is outdated, false, or downright stupid. What we do is dangerous. There’s no reason to make it worse.
I apologize again, and I promise to pick right back up where I left off. And if there’s anything I can do for anyone, please let me know. Thank you guys so much!

Fuck, Christmas Dinner…
Dec19
…Down to 192!! Woot!!!
The last few days, I’ve been a wreck. I’ve eaten everything in sight, and I’ve kept half of it down. If it wasn’t for Christmas being so soon, I’d go on my water fast now and say fuck it. Fuck food, I’m done. I think I’ll say that after Christmas. But Christmas time, I’m going to be expected to eat. Purging in a house full of people isn’t going to go over too smoothly. I can pass off the meat and sweets, since everyone in my family knows I’m vegan now. But not eating is not an option.
Last night, we went to this restaurant. And as if it wasn’t expensive enough, my mother sat right next to me. I had no choice but to eat. So I figured I’d enjoy myself. I stuffed my face stupidly and then got rid of it in the bathroom. Then later on at the house, I started eating a handful of trail mix. Got out of hand, and then had to purge again. Told my mom I was going to the bathroom and then I’d help her finish with the tree (we were decorating). After I purged, I helped for a while and then ate a pickle. Pickles are my safe food. She said, “I think you went into the bathroom and hurled. Where are you putting all this food?!” I was dying of laughter on the inside. She has no idea.
Today, I’ve eaten everything. Everything. That leftover vegetable hibachi from the restaurant was so good… I ate it, purged, then ate some more and tried to purge again. By that time, I was so sick I couldn’t do it. I stood in the mirror, and literally, out loud, begged myself in the mirror, “Please don’t make me do this.” And the inner mother in me said it was okay, that I didn’t have to this time. I could have a break. My scale will hate me tomorrow morning. I hate myself today. I may not even weigh tomorrow. Fml…
I will be starting a water fast on December 26th. And in the meantime, what are you guys planning on doing to survive Christmas? I know, I know… But one more big day, and then we’re done for a whole year. We can do this!! Share your Christmas dinner tips below. In the meantime, here’s some of mine:
1.  You might be able to avoid eating altogether. Complain that morning of being sick, and LIGHTLY dust your face with baby powder to look a bit pale. If you normally wear makeup, don’t. Then you can get away with either not eating at all, or eating very lightly. No one will wonder why you’re not eating. They’ll know you’re sick. Obviously though, you probably shouldn’t try this if your family is already onto you.
2.  I don’t even like bringing purging up as an option… But, desperate times. If you must eat, and there’s no way to avoid it, a couple of fingers can undo it all.
3.  Fast for three days in advance. Then eat lightly. If you stuff yourself all at once after a three-day fast, you’re going to make yourself sick. Definitely will inspire control.
4.  Cross one leg over the over, and make sure you’re scooted up under the table enough to hide your lap. Put a napkin down in the gap in your lap right where your crotch is (there’s no good way to word this). Don’t cross your legs; the outside of one ankle should be sitting on your other leg’s knee. Practice in advance to figure out what I’m talking about. See the gap there? Good. Stick a napkin down in there and make like a garbage can. Then fill ‘er up. That a girl!
5.  Will there be pets there? Thank God!! Feed them. Make sure you get mostly stuff they will eat. Like… Of course they’ll eat turkey. Get turkey. Mashed potatoes? Get them. Green beans? Probably not, but you can eat those. Feed those dogs the best meal they’ve ever had!
6.  Avoid the dark glass trick. Repeating AVOID THE DARK GLASS TRICK. Odds are, you won’t be the one to empty your glass. And Lucy shouldn’t have to explain shit on Christmas, but if you get caught… *gulp*
7.  If all else fails… If ALL else fails… Get small portions of everything and let that be your total caloric intake for the day. Don’t go over 800, and you’ll be fine. If you load up on things like carrots and vegetables, you can do it. Turkey is relatively low-cal, too. Even a spoon of mashed potatoes won’t be too horrible if that’s all you’re eating for the day. And just don’t do dessert, period. You can say you’re too full for dessert. Most people are.
Let me know what your tips and tricks are for surviving the holidays. Good luck, Ana family!

An Anorexic Thanksgiving
Nov29
Down to 207! And I’d be down lower if I had this purging crap under control. *sigh…*
Today, it was cereal, teddy Graham’s, pb&j, cookie dough, and chicken. Got most of it up before my throat swelled and said no more. So, now I’m noticing a pattern with my purging, at least. If I purge more than once a day, and if it’s a lot of food, I won’t be able to get it all up. Normal-sized meals once a say are fine. But I’ve just said fuck it today. Probably ate up near 800 calories. Yuck…
How did YOU deal with the holidays? Let me know in the comments!

Smoking Elitist
Nov20
Lunch at work Purged. And it was delicious.
Dinner at home Purged. And it was spicy chili. Ouch.
I love being an anonymous writer. I can blog about my mother and no one will ever know. That being said, my mother is driving me nuts. She walked in my room and said, “I’m so disappointed in you. I don’t even want to talk to you right now.” Then she walked out. She was mad that I was smoking again, but whatever. Anything to suppress some of these cravings. In six months when I’m thin and she’s still fat, I’m going to ask her how that weight loss program is coming along for her. The sooner I can get my own place, the better. I’m in an ever-shrinking elite group whose condition is entirely unknown, and I’d like to stay in that group.
Short-term goal weight is 199. Only 13 more! Long-term is 120. I’ll get there. I’m tough. I can do this. My stomach is just trying to get me into trouble, and I’m not going to let it do that.

Damn you, Plateau!!
Nov19
I’m stuck on a plateau. 😦
They suck, don’t they? I was stuffing my face and purging, and I lost like mad. Now that I’m just restricting, I can’t lose crap. And all you Anas know, that’s quite a literal statement. Actually, the only strange thing to happen here is, I haven’t had my period in over a year. Guess who decided to show up…
I’m thinking about getting lunch today at work. And then I’ll try to throw it up. That seems to be the only thing that works anymore. I’m thinking… Pizza… Gosh, I’ve been wanting some. And where I work, they have some amazing pizza. Or maybe I’ll get a package of cookies and just shovel them in. Mmmmm… Wish me luck!
Stuck at 212.
