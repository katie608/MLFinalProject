Some inspirational lyrics...
Ana's Song - Silverchair
Please die AnaFor as long as you're here we're notYou make the sound of laughterand sharpened nails seem
softerAnd I need you now somehowAnd I need you now somehowOpen fire on the needs designedOn my knees for
youOpen fire on my knees desiresWhat I need from youImagine pageantIn my head the flesh seems thickerSandpaper
tears corrode the filmAnd I need you now somehowAnd I need you now somehowOpen fire on the needs designedOn
my knees for youOpen fire on my knees desiresWhat I need from youAnd you're my obsessionI love you to
the bonesAnd Ana wrecks your lifeLike an Anorexia lifeOpen fire on the needs designedOn my knees for youOpen
fire on my knees desiresWhat I need from youOpen fire on the needs designedOpen fire on my knees desiresOn
my knees for you
Paper Bag - Fiona Apple
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a starTo pray on, or wish on, or something like thatI was having a sweet
fix of a daydream of a boyWhose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be hadBut then the dove of hope began its downward
slopeAnd I believed for a moment that my chancesWere approaching to be grabbedBut as it came down near, so did
a weary tearI thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean upI got to fold 'cause
these hands are too shaky to holdHunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love
And I went crazy again today, looking for a strand to climbLooking for a little hopeBaby said he couldn't stay,
wouldn't put his lips to mine,And a fail to kiss is a fail to copeI said, 'Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel
justifiedCome on put a little love here in my void,' he said'It's all in your head,' and I said, 'So's everything'
But he didn't get it I thought he was a manBut he was just a little boy
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean upI got to fold 'cause
these hands are too shaky to holdHunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to loveHunger hurts, and
I want him so bad, oh it kills'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean upI got to fold 'cause these hands are
too shaky to holdHunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love
She's Falling Apart - Lisa Loeb
They pull up their chairs to the tableShe stares at the food on her plateAt
the toast and the butterHer father, herÂ mother, she pushes awayAnd they rise in the morningAnd they sleep
in the darkAnd even though nobody's lookingShe's falling apartShe gets home from school too earlyAnd closes
the door to her roomThere's nothing inside herShe's weak and she's tired of feeling like thisAnd they rise
in the morningAnd they sleep in the darkAnd even though nobody's lookingShe's falling apartThey call her
for dinner, she makes up a reasonShe looks at her arms and she rolls down her sleevesAnd her mother is starting to
see through her liesAnd last night her father had tears in his eyesAnd they rise in the morningAnd they sleep
in the darkAnd even though nobody's lookingShe's falling apartAnd we rise in the morningAnd we sleep in
the darkAnd even though nobody's lookingShe's falling apart
Messiah - Anorexia Nervosa
Time of puberty
Age of quandary
Sorrow and worries
Disagreement
Predicament
I enigmatize
Weakness overcomes my body, my brain's so empty
I lose my appetite, day in day out
My body's deeply marked, I'm undernourished
Mental changes, my mind is splitting
Inferiority complexes, time to confess
Pride and power, is giving me the hunger
Depression and apathy, is changing my spirit
Time to go hungry
It gives me great joy
Pleasure and satisfaction
To fight against
My hunger pangs
Gives me pride
Feeling of sheer terror
To see me in the mirror
I could be so fat
Every pound I lose
Helps me on the course
To my sheer perfection
I don't realize how bad my body's feeling
My eyes see only my perfect slim body
But really I'm a half-starved skeleton
Lucy at the Gym - Jill Sobule
Lucy at the gym
She's there every time I go,
and I don't go that often, so she must live at the gym
I stare at her ribs they show through the spandex
Her little legs are working, she's going somewhere
She's climbing up the stairs
And when she reaches the top her dreams will be there
Lucy at the gym
Lucy on the scale for the third time
Thru thick and thin, Lucy's at the gym
She's staring at the clock and like the 2nd hand she never stops
She's Lucy at the gym
When she takes a shower, after all the hours
Does she have a place to go
Is there someone waiting
Or is Lucy all alone
I'm at the gym and Lucy's not there
It's got me kinda worried so I imagine the worst
She's made it up to heaven
And when she met her maker, he said "come right in"
"I'll show you around the gym"
"Everyone's beautiful and thin"
"And here there's no sin, and your life can begin
Lucy at the gym"
Big Isn't Beautiful - King Andora
I want your heart-shaped lips, lips,
Cooler hula hips,
I want to feel my bones on your
bones, yeah,
I wear my heartache at my sleeve,
I love myself too much to see,
It haunts my dreams,
It haunts my every dream,
Every boy wants a body to die for and,
Every girl who's thin is his rival,
I wish I had a body to die for,
Skinny is sexy,
Big isn't beautiful....
I'm gonna shed me some skin,
Get me real, real slim,
I want to feel my bones on your
bones, baby,
I am a teenage drama queen,
I throw my guts up for self-esteem,
It haunts my dreams,
It haunts my every dream,
Every boy wants a body to die for,
And every girl who's thin is his rival,
I wish I had a body to die for,
Skinny is sexy,
Big isn't beautiful,
Ohh, ohh, ohh,
Every boy wants a body to die for and,
Every girl who's thin is his rival,
I wish I had a a body to die for,
Skinny is sexy,
Sweet anorexia,
Skinny is sexy,
Big isn't beautiful....
