Pro Ana Tips and Tricks for Beginners
Never skip your breakfast. Studies have shown that the people who eat breakfast make a better choice of food that they will have later in the day. Besides, breakfast accelerated your metabolism for the day ahead.
If you have things that you shouldn’t have then make sure you hide them.
Try not to drink tons of water at one go, and that too on an empty stomach. It will just make you gassy. Small sips of water throughout the day will be of great help.
Your metabolism will be negatively affected if you sleep for 6 hours a day or less. And as a result, your body starts producing more hormone that increases your hunger. So instead of staying up for long to burn calories on the exercise bike, take proper sleep.
Don’t stop yourself from having anything. This will only increase your wish to binge. And so if you want to have anything from the list of “Bad Foods”, then go ahead. But make sure you have only a few bites. This will help you enjoy the dieting process, and stronger you will for further extreme dieting.
Smaller meals during the day will help to boost your metabolism and burn more calories.
Find the vegetable and fruits that you like. This way you won’t feel eating healthy food is a chore. And then you will avoid rewarding yourself with calorie food like cake or ice cream.
Similarly, find the exercise that you love to do. If the weather out there is hot, then avoid running. You can either go swimming or do work out seeing the videos on YouTube.
Make lunch for yourself. You can make a nice sandwich with some fresh fruit juice. And then after reaching school or workplace, either share it with your BFF or give it away to someone who forgot their lunch.
Be prepared with an answer for questions like ‘are you eating’ or ‘have you lost weight’.
In case you have hidden food that you had to eat long back, then make sure fix it or dispose of it ASAP. Take same consideration while disposing of the bag of puke that you had hidden in the closet.
Consumption of laxatives is often recommended, but they hardly affect calorie consumption
Be ready with a few excuses of eating less or salad as an excuse of food poisoning every time becomes fishy.
Avoid brushing your teeth after purging as it can cause damage to the enamel leading to faster decay of your teeth.
Use measuring tapes to track the progress instead of scales or mirrors. You will see yourself as a hippo even when you have converted into a skeleton.
If you will not eat enough, your blood sugar will drop. As a result, you will start feeling weak and dizzy along with horrible headaches.
Eating cabbage is a good idea to lose weight, but it can be smelly.
Though it is always said that one should sit and eat. But as standing and eating burn more calories, try doing that.
