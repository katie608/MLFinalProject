It’s 2018, and the media hates us. Type in pro ana blog, and half the results is shaming us for not eating, for having these blogs. Plus, most of the pro ana blogs left are from, like, 2014. I was tired of going through half-finished, out-of-date blogs, so I made my own.
i support recovery, but am not in it myself.
My name is Caty. I’m 16, and I live in the United States. If you want to become ana buddies, or join a group chat, my kik is catyspacen. I’m 5’5, my starting weight was 125 lbs, my goal weight is 100 lbs, and my ultimate goal weight is 88 lbs. Currently, I am 109 (March 30 2019).
Pro ana is not a religion here- just a lifestyle. I’m not trying to teach you to have an eating disorder, this is merely a refuge. It’s that little voice inside our head that we can’t seem to shake, but at least we don’t have to do it alone.
So welcome, love you lots. Remember, calories are the enemy. You have control, you barely eat, and nothing tastes as good as skinny feels. Saying no to food is saying yes to skinny. But also, we are here to be skinny, NOT dead or hospitalized. And no one must EVER find out.

let’s get real
May 1, 2019 caty3 Comments
Hey everyone! I know it’s been a couple days, I’ve just been crazy busy! I thought I would do a post based on something that came up in a group chat today. This is a little different from what I normally do, but I hope y’all enjoy! Also, to the person who requested workouts, that’ll be my next post 🙂
I think it’s easy to get mixed up in perception vs reality, especially in our community, because it is virtually all over the internet, not face to face. We see each other through a screen, and sometimes all we see is words spoken. Especially on blogs and tumblrs. It’s a little more real when it comes to kik, but even then, not much.
Here’s where my idea to write this came from. I sent my food log to a group chat, which read 486 consumed, 428 burned, net 59. The responses ranged from “Wow Caty, you are so in control!” to “Omg perfect” and to “I wish I could do that, you make it look so easy” and so on and so forth. I didn’t think I had done anything remarkable. So I looked at it again. I realized that it did look good. On paper. But I didn’t mention how 300 of those calories came from me eating mini muffins, crying about it in my room, and then working out out of self hate to burn it off.
We are all struggling. Just because it looks pretty on paper, doesn’t mean it’s pretty in real life. I get responses from my blog asking me to coach, people telling me I’m perfect, I’m in control, and so on and so forth. I am here to tell you I am NOT PERFECT. I struggle, I feel like I’ve failed myself, I binge, I cry, I want to die sometimes. Just because I run a blog does not magically make me a “better ana”.
Which brings me into my next point. Everyone’s struggle is different. There is no perfect weigh, no perfect amount of calories, no perfect amount of exercise.. you get the point. 800 calories is a good day for some, and 800 calories is considered a binge to others. It is all about your personal journey. Don’t compare your struggle. EVERYONE IS VALID. 120 pounds can be an extremely underweight weight on some heights, while 120 can also be perfectly attainable on other heights, and considered high on other heights. With that being said, please never let your BMI fall below 15.0. That’s when organs start to fail. That’s when you start to die. We want to be skinny, not dead.
Alternatively, I know a lot of us feel alone sometimes. I hope that my posts have given you some kind of solace that you are not alone. Here’s a little more reassurance that you aren’t the only one struggling. I am in multiple group chats on kik, each with around 20. All different people. I had a tumblr with 2k (terminated), .8k (terminated), and my current has .5k. Mostly different people. All struggling. This blog averages 400 views a day. Not all are the same. All struggling. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. If you feel comfortable, post in the comments how you struggle so others can see they are not alone.
I know we compare ourselves to thinspo, but we should never compare our struggles. You are always valid. No matter what.
You can always Contact me, kik me (catyspacen) and we can chat or I can add you to a group chat, or contact my tumblr (skinnygirlcornerrr). I’ll always be here for you, no matter what. I’ll always be a friend. I love and adore each and every one of you. You give me so much purpose and I will always give back to you.
stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny.

The Business of Skinny
April 27, 2019 caty1 Comment
Hey everyone! I know it’s been a couple of days since I last uploaded, I was super super busy! I’m back now with a lengthy post that I hope you’ll find interesting. If you remember when I asked if I should do something relating to Poshmark, I got a lot of positive responses, so this will include that! Quick disclaimer, I’ll be adding invite codes for some of these resources, but I am not paid and in no way affiliated with the companies. I’ll be super transparent to why I’m giving you them. Hope you enjoy!
POSHMARK
Poshmark is by far my favorite app for reselling. I think it has to do with the social aspect, with sharing, commenting, making friends, etc! I’ll be breaking down what it’s all about, how to get started, tips, and why it relates to us!
What is Poshmark?
Poshmark is a buying and selling app and website! You can find new and preloved items at a fraction of the cost! It’s a great way to save money and save the Earth! If you didn’t know, the amount of water it takes to make ONE pair of jeans could provide water for someone for 900 days. That’s two and a half years. Not to mention, when you buy secondhand, all the nasty dyes that go into a piece of clothing are already washed out!
How can I get started?
First, set up an account! Be careful with what you set your username as, though, because you can’t change it. When you sign up, you’ll see a box for an invite code. This is the only time you can input one, so do it! I wish I had! What does it do? It automatically gives you $5 to use towards a purchase! The person that referred you will only receive $5 towards their account if you buy something. I’d love it if you used mineSECONDSTOPPOSH. That’s also my user!! If you do join, let me know you’re from here and I’ll shout you out and share your listings!
Once you’ve decided you want to start selling, do this:
Take CLEAR photos on a plain backdrop with natural light! I do mine on a white wall with a Canon Rebel T6 (but this isn’t necessary. I have one because I love photography, so it’s just a plus I can use it for Poshmark.) Phone cameras work just fine!
In your title, first list brand, then style if you can find it, then what the item is, then color. (exBrandy Melville Laila Thermal Black). This is SEO (search engine optimization).
Write an accurate description. Include what the material is like, if it’s true to size, when you are likely to ship, if prices are negotiable, etc.
Always label brand correctly. You have no idea how many people mistag brands for exposure, and it can get you banned. Don’t do it.
Look up comps (what a similar item from the same brand SOLD for) and use that to get an approximate of what you should list it for. Always price $5 higher than what you want to get for an item to leave room for offers.
FOLLOW! I cannot stress this enough. It’s easy to get caught up in the Instagram norm (more followers than following) but it doesn’t matter on Poshmark. The more you follow, the more you grow!
SHARE SHARE SHARE!!! Self share and community share! The share button is the little icon with arrows on the bottom of a listing. Sharing is great for not only you, but also the community! It’s a great way to build friendships.
Packaging- Poshmark soley ships through USPS Priority Mail. If you go to the USPS website, you can order FREE Priority Mail shipping supplies, including tape! I also recommend picking up tissue paper (after Christmas is such a good time!) to wrap your sold items in, and add a little thank you note! It’s a sweet personal touch that’s really meaningful.
That’s the basics! I’ll go into some more tips in a minute.
Okay, but now I need to make a sale!
That was just to get you started- here are some of my favorite tips.
Watch Poshmark YouTubers! They have a lot of great tips when it comes to packaging, what sells, how to sell faster, really everything!
30 Minute Method. This is a theory that a Posher came up with to hit all of the categories in the Poshmark Algorithm to optimize sales. I use it and it definitely works, and I can usually complete it in around 15 minutes. Here it is-
Be consistent! Try to share, list, etc at the same time or rate. For example, I always to the 30MM in order, I always list 5 a day, and I always share my whole closet at night.
Share your items to parties! It really helps with exposure.
DO NOT LOWBALL. Poshmark already takes 20%, and it’s definitely a good idea to make offers since sellers usually accept, but do it graciously. For example, if an item is listed for $25, the seller only gets $20 of that. I wouldn’t offer anything less than around $20. At $20, the seller gets $16. It’s good to be mindful!
Use offers to likers! Poshmark has a feature where you can send offers directly to likers. The offer has to be at least 10% lower than your price and include a shipping discount. People on Poshmark are looking for a deal, so this is a great way to make sales! I’ve had tons of people buy because of this (and I’ve bought because of this!!)
Utilize social media. I created an Instagram specifically for my Poshmark, and it’s another great way to boost your account, and more importantly, make friends! Mine is @ secondstopposh.
Well, this sounds good and all, but what does it have to do with us / your blog?
It actually has a lot to do with us! First of all, when you’ve lost enough weight to not fit into clothes anymore, you can sell them! It’s great motivation, because if you don’t have that size anymore, then you can’t gain weight to go back up to it! And you’re making money to buy smaller clothes!
It’s also great motivation to lose weight! You can look through all the cute xs clothes, and since you can buy them for less (and get nicer brands!) you’ll have more cute clothes to show off on your tiny body!
So that’s my spiel on Poshmark. I seriously love it so much. Comment or contact me if you have any questions! If you buy from my closet, let me know you’re from here so I can personalize your package (I’ll send some thinspo too!)
Also, most of these tips apply to other reselling apps, like Mercari and Depop!
SAVING MONEY
So, it can definitely be hard to save money for your ugw, especially when it seems so far away. I did my research on some savings apps and ended up settling on Digit. It had the most aesthetically pleasing format, is FDIC insured, allows for multiple saving goals at the same time, and has a feature that doesn’t allow your bank account to fall under a certain amount. If you sign up using MY CODE, then we both get $5 into our savings! And if I get 5 referrals in a week, then Digit will give me $100, and that would really help me out! Once you sign up, you’ll get an invite code where you’ll get the same chance, so definitely share it with your friends!
That’s all I have for today! I know it’s long, but I hope it was useful! Be active in the comments, and as always,
stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny.

Looking and feeling like my real self.
Looking in the mirror and being able to proudly say, “That’s me!”
No fat rolls rolling up on themselves when I’m trying to sleep comfortably.
Skinny, pretty face with a razor sharp jaw.
Fitting just about anywhere.
Enjoying every bite of tiny food instead of taking eating for granted.
Feeling cooler in the summer!
Looking like a doll in winter clothes (versus looking like a rotund snowman).
Anyways, I had so much fun reading these and I felt like I got to know some of my readers better! They were also super motivating for me! Should I do more of these interactive posts? And if you have any post requests, let me know!
stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny.

starve + sip 2
April 16, 2019 caty11 Comments
Hey everyone!! I’m back again with another starve + sip so I have the opportunity to chat with y’all a little bit! Let me know if I should continue doing these or not, and remember to let me know your reasons to be skinny, because they’ll be featured in my next post!! You can contact me or comment below!
My life has honestly been a whirlwind. I left my friend group about a month ago, and it’s been spiraling downwards since then. I had prom last Saturday and ended up going with another group. It was super fun and all, until my old friends (one in particular) started a bunch of drama for no reason at all.
It was really sucky to go through at the time, but I didn’t want it to ruin my night, so I let it go. I ended up going to another friends house to party and we had edibles which was super fun, The next day my old friend texted me a bunch of nasty stuff and it really shook me up, but I got over it.
Besides for that, I’ve actually been doing well! My Poshmark has been poppin lately (along with my Mercari, Depop, and Vinted) which is really awesome! I’m going sourcing this Saturday which is my favorite part. If you guys want my username, contact me or shoot me a text through my kik (catyspacen) because I don’t want it linked on here, since it’s an ana blog.
I was also thinking about doing a post about it on here because I’m super passionate about it! I could do tips on selling/buying, a guide, how it motivates me to be skinny, or a combination! Let me know your thoughts 🙂
Other than swimming, that’s about all I have to update y’all on!
stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny.

How to look skinny faster
April 15, 2019 caty3 Comments
Hey lovelies! Today I’m back with another tip post. I might do another starve + sip where we can chat, and then I’ll be posting the reasons y’all sent me on why you want to be skinny! Keep submitting them either through CONTACT or by leaving a comment on this. Enjoy!
We all see the number dropping on the scale, but then we look in the mirror, and nothing. Or a ghost of a thigh gap even though we’ve worked so hard. A lot of the reason for this is because our bodies aren’t toned. Weights don’t solve the problem because we also don’t want to look muscular. But there’s a fix!
STRETCHING. Boom. A concept. It really works!! I stretch every night for anywhere from 5-15 minutes. I used to be a dancer, so I have a regiment to follow, but if you have no idea where to start, go to youtube and follow along to some videos. You’ll see results in the mirror faster and you’ll be flexible!!
Here are some of my favorite stretches:
wall splits
straddle, then reach to one leg, hold. repeat.
sitting pike and hold
spider crawls (a super exaggerated side lunge, crawl to other side and repeat)
both legs turned out at 90 degree angles, then raise up on tip toes
butterfly, knees to ground, head over feet
Here are some of my favorite videos:
Kristina Kay
Erica Lin
blogilates
Alivia D’Andrea
And my fav playlists!

Timber
Chill Out
Composure

Hope you enjoyed! Let me know how it goes for you!
stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny.

Hey everyone! I wanted to start a new series on here that I’ll hopefully continue doing. The thought behind this was to be a little series where I would just sit down and chat with you guys (while we sip our green tea, of course.) Kind of like they do on YouTube! Let me know what you guys think of this, and if i should continue it or not!
So my prom is coming up.. literally next Saturday. I’m really nervous because I want to be around 105 then but idk if I can do that. My plan is to fast until lunch, have a rice cake, then eat oatmeal for dinner if my parents are around. If not, I won’t eat. Then I’ll water (and tea) fast the two days before prom! I’m hoping that will work.
I’ve also been really into Poshmark lately. I’ve been having so much fun running my shop. I love fashion and it gives me a calming sense of purpose. I went out sourcing Saturday and picked up some cool pieces! My fav was a pair of J.Crew paperbag waist shorts. I also went to Plato’s and found a brandy tank and a pair of Levi’s shorts. It’s such a cute outfit and it’s great motivation for me to lose weight!
Today was a more laid back day, but that doesn’t mean I wasn’t busy. I took and edited hundreds of pictures for my Poshmark, then listed and drafted about half, which took quite a while. Then I cross posted, which means I listed them on a bunch of different sites (I also am on Mercari, Vinted, and Depop). It took me basically all day. If you’d like the accounts I sell on, feel free to message me through Contact or Kik me at catyspacen. I just don’t want to link those accounts on here because those contain a lot of my real identity and I’m trying to stay somewhat anonymous.
Tomorrow I have tutoring to go to because I literally suck at math. I also have a chem test which I’m a little nervous for because I’m really trying to pull my grade up in that class. I have the SAT Tuesday so I’m hoping that goes well.
That’s all I have for you guys right now! Keep me updated on yall’s lives, especially during diets and fasts! Let me know if I should continue doing these!
stay safe, stay strong, stay skinny.
